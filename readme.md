## Silver Platter for XCode
Silver Platter contains xcode file templates and a script for creating functional reactive projects quickly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
1. 'cd' into the silver-platter directory.
1. Run 'make'. #WARNING: If you have a silver-platter directory in your XCode templates folder it will be deleted.
1. The templates are now copied and ready to be used with XCode.
1. Run ./install.sh.
1. Build all the targets separately in xcode.
1. You're all set!

Note:
When using our file templates you have to manually change the target for each of the generated files.
